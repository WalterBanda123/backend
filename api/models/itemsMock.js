      but the majority have suffered alteration in some form,
       by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look 
       even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of
        Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything 
        embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum 
        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as 
        necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. `,

    description: `Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply 
    random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature 
    from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
     a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked 
     up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, 
     from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the 
     cites of the word in classical literature, discovered 
     the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 
     1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
     (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 
     45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
      very popular during the Renaissance`,
